%%% Clinic reports use the clinic class, which should be located
%%% somewhere in TeX's search path.

%%% For your ``statement of work'' (or ``work statement''), specify
%%% the ``proposal'' document-class option to the hmcclinic class.
\documentclass[proposal]{hmcclinic}

%%% The major difference between the statement of work and a midyear
%%% or final report is that the statement of work is typeset as an
%%% article, which means that the highest level of structural
%%% division available to you is section rather than chapter.

%%% There are also some changes in pagination styles and content
%%% that reflect the briefer nature of the proposal.  For example,
%%% in the longer reports, you use \frontmatter, \mainmatter, and
%%% \backmatter to separate some sections of the report from
%%% others.  In the statement of work, you don't need those
%%% commands, as no such division is necessary.

%%% Other packages needed by your document may be loaded here.
% \usepackage{url}              % For formatting URLs and other web or
                                % file references.

%%% Provide additional context around errors. 
\setcounter{errorcontextlines}{1000}


%%% Information about this document.

%%% I find it most useful to put identifying information about a
%%% document near the top of the preamble.  Technically, this
%%% information must precede the \maketitle command, which often
%%% appears immediately after the beginning of the document 
%%% environment.  Placing it near the top of the document makes it
%%% easier to identify the document, and keeps it out from getting
%%% mixed up with the real meat of the document.

%%% We use the same set of commands for specifying information about
%%% the people involved with the project that are used in the longer
%%% reports, so you can copy most of this information directly into
%%% your midyear and final reports.

%%% So, some questions.

%% What is the name of the company or organization sponsoring your project?
\sponsor{Harvey Mudd College}

%% What is the title of your report?
\title{Statement of Work}

%% Who are the authors of the report (your team members)?  (Separate
%% names with \and.)
\author{Brett Collins (Project Manager) \and Alex Gruver \and Ellen Hui \and
Tyler Marklyn}

%% What is your faculty advisor's name?  (Again, separate names with
%% \and, if necessary.)
\advisor{Jeff Amelang}

%% Liaison's name or names?
\liaison{Carter Edwards \and Robert Hoekstra}

%% Did you have an outside consultant help you with this project?  Put
%% their names in the \consultant command.

%%% End of information section.

%%% New commands and environments.

%%% You can define your own commands and environments here.  If you
%%% have a lot of material here, you might want to consider splitting
%%% the commands and environments into a separate ``style'' file that
%%% you load with \usepackage.

\newcommand{\coolcommand}[1]{#1 is cool.} % Lets everyone know that
                                % the person or thing that you provide
                                % as the argument to the command is
                                % cool.


%%% Some theorem-like command definitions.

%%% The \newtheorem command comes from the amsthm package.  That
%%% package is loaded by the class file.

%%% Note that these definitions have changed from the version in the
%%% sample report document by dropping the ``within'' argument.  See
%%% Gratzer's _Math into LaTeX_ or the AMS-LaTeX documentation for
%%% more details.

% \newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Theo1}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Theo2}{Theorem}
% \newtheorem{Lemma}{Lemma}


%%% If you find that some words in your document are being hyphenated
%%% incorrectly, you can specify the correct hyphenation using the
%%% \hyphenation command.  Note that words are separated by
%%% whitespace, as shown below.

\hyphenation{ap-pen-dix wer-ther-i-an}


%%% The start of the document!

%% The document environment is the main environment in any LaTeX
%% document.  It contains other environments, as well as your text.

\begin{document}

%%% In a longer document (such as your midterm and final reports),
%%% you would have separate \frontmatter, \mainmatter, and
%%% \backmatter commands to define some large chunks of your
%%% document.  For the Statement of Work, which is a short document,
%%% we don't need these commands.

%%% Your Statement of Work begins with a title page.  The title page
%%% is formatted by commands in the document class file, so you
%%% don't need to worry about what it looks like -- just putting the
%%% \maketitle command in your document (and filling in the necessary
%%% information for the identification commands above) is enough.
\maketitle

%%% In a longer document or an article being submitted to a journal
%%% or conference, you would probably have an abstract that
%%% summarized the purpose of the document.  We don't need that for
%%% a Statement of Work.

%%% Similarly, in longer documents you would probably have commands
%%% to include a table of contents and lists of figures or tables.
%%% For a short document such as the Statement of Work, we don't
%%% need these commands.


%%% Content.

%%% For smaller documents---especially those you're writing by
%%% yourself---you might write your entire report using a single LaTeX
%%% source file.  For larger documents, we recommend that you split
%%% the source file into several separate, smaller files.  The smaller
%%% files are ``included'' into your main, or ``master'' document
%%% using \include commands.  See the template file for the Clinic
%%% reports for more details on how to split a LaTeX project into
%%% smaller files.


%%% The body of your Statement of Work should appear here.  See
%%% Chapter 4 in _The Mathematics Clinic in Brief: A Handbook_ for
%%% more details on what you should include in a Statement of Work.

\section{Problem Statement}

Sandia National Laboratories currently has many libraries and legacy code that
do not utilize new manycore architectures. We will make Sandia's tensor contractions
library and, as time permits, other libraries thread scalable using their self
developed Kokkos library.

% TODO

\section{Background}

Sandia National Laboratories is a federally funded research and development
center owned and managed by the Sandia Corporation.  The laboratory's primary
focus is the maintenance, management, and development of the United States'
nuclear arsenal.  Sandia also performs research in the fields of supercomputing
and scientific computing.  The Trilinos Project, developed and maintained by
Sandia, is a collection of open source libraries intended for use in large-scale
scientific applications.

One of the packages in Trilinos is Kokkos, which is designed to aid portability
and performance in software written for manycore architectures.  Well designed
and well implemented parallelism can yield significant speedup in certain
processing-heavy applications, including many in the scientific computing
domain.

An area where existing code could be drastically improved is in the use of
Graphical Processing Units (GPUs).  Compared to traditional CPUs, GPUs have far
more cores specialized to handle many threads at once.  In FLOP heavy
applications, GPUs can be considerably faster, more energy efficient, and
cheaper to use than CPUs.

However, optimizing an application to take advantage of many cores is highly
dependent on the architecture on which the application is to run.  In addition,
highly parallel code may suffer from race conditions between threads, causing
either incorrect results or slower runtimes resulting from the steps necessary
to ensure correctness.

Kokkos attempts to mitigate these issues by allowing programmers to
write their code once, and compile for optimization on a variety of
manycore architectures.  This is possible because the library manages the
allocation of memory for the programmer and optimizes storage for speed on
the current architecture. Kokkos also allows users to write thread scalable
software by providing an API for using fast, non-locking data structures.

However, the Kokkos package is still new and relatively untested.  No
large-scale projects have yet been written with it.  Some small kernels
have been rewritten using Kokkos, but there are still many kernels in Trilinos
that would benefit from increased thread scalable parallelization.


\section{Goal}

The goal of this clinic is to rewrite several Trilinos kernels to be efficient
and thread-scalable on manycore architectures, using Kokkos.  These redesigned
and reimplemented kernels will be integrated into Trilinos' production code, as
both a performance improvement and as an example of a compelling use case for
Kokkos.

We plan to work on kernels from Intrepid, a tensor manipulation library, as well
as kernels from one of these libraries: x, y, z.
% (TODO fill this in later.)

\section{Objectives}

The objective of this project is to refactor, or rewrite the tensor manipulation 
and one another library using Kokkos in order to make them thread scalable. This
objective can be broken down into sub-objectives which include getting familiar
with Kokkos and the current libraries, measuring the performance gains of the 
threaded libraries, and ensuring correctness using the provided tests. The tasks
section will break down the sub-objectives further and describe what is necessary
to complete the objectives.

\subsection{Optional Objectives}



The objectives presented in this section are to be done if time
permits. Firstly, if the team has finished, or has made significant progess
towards making Sandia's tensor manipulation library thread scalable, then a
seminar on the experience of using Kokkos will be given to a group of Sandia's 
employees during the site visit. After making two different libraries thread
scalable there are a couple different objectives the team can pursue, which
includes making more libraries thread scalable or writing parallel versions of 
the first two libraries in CUDA or another framework. Continuing our work to
make more libraries thread scalable has clear benefits for Sandia, such as 
decreasing code runtimes. While rewritting the tensor manipulation library
in CUDA will make it easy to compare Kokkos to CUDA.


\section{Tasks}

Our first task for this semester is to acquire a desktop with suitable
computational capabilities. In practice, this translates to either an NVIDIA
K20X tesla card or an NVIDIA Titan (Jeff please confirm) . This will allow us to
test the thread scalability of our programs and ensure that they meet Sandia's
needs.

After this, we will try to familiarize ourselves with massively multithreaded
programming by working through a series of example problems in a variety of
environments. So far, we have identified numerical integration, matrix
multiplication, and histogram calculations as likely candidates for practice
problems. We will try to implement these problems in Intel's Threaded Building
Blocks, CUDA, and OpenMP.

After familiarizing ourselves with TBB, CUDA and OpenMP, we will have a
background to understand the ideal way to write code using Kokkos. At this
point, we will begin to write solutions to our practice problems using Kokkos.
We can then compare the speedup gains on Kokkos compared to the other
libraries, and also the ease of writing thread scalable code using Kokkos
compared to the other libraries. This will be good practice because ideally, we
will also test a few of the kernels we write so that we can see differences in
ease of coding and speedup in them as well.

At this point, we will shift our focus to our first kernel.
While we have a significant mathematics background none of us have any
experience with tensor contraction.  We will need to explore the main
algorithms used for tensor contraction and determine if there are existing
procedures for parallelizing the process. The original Kokkos source code,
along with online materials should help us with this.

Once we are familiar with Kokkos, and we feel we have enough of a background
with the technologies, we will begin working on improving the tensor
contraction library. At this point in the project it is difficult to create an accurate timeline
for this process, but we hope that we will be able to present our progress at 
the end of semester site visit at Sandia.

After the tensor contraction library ...... TODO
%%% Appendices.

%%% For your Statement of Work, you probably won't have any
%%% appendices, but you could include some if you really needed to.

%%% The appendices are delineated with the \appendix command.
%%% Individual appendices are begun with the standard \chapter or
%%% \section commands.  In our example, we'll \include them just as we
%%% did other chapters.

%%% Even in a relatively short document such as your statement of
%%% work, you might need to have appendices.  If so, uncomment
%%% the \appendix command and add them below (remember, the
%%% top-level structural command in this format is section).

% \appendix


%%% Bibliography.

%%% BibTeX is the tool to use for citations and layout of your
%%% bibliography.  Instead of having to type ``[5]'' or ``(Jones,
%%% 1968)'' (and keep track of which citation is which and renumber
%%% them as you add more references to your bibilography), you use
%%% special commands that allow BibTeX and LaTeX to automatically put
%%% the correct information in the right place.

%%% Section 5.6 in _The Mathematics Clinic in Brief: A Handbook_,
%%% talks about using BibTeX to format your bibliography and
%%% citations.

%%% Depending on your field, it may or may not be appropriate to list
%%% references for which you haven't included specific citations.  If
%%% your field sanctions such practices, or if you just want to get an
%%% idea of what you have in your bibliography file, you can include
%%% everything with the \nocite{*} command.
\nocite{*} 


%%% The appearance of your bibliography and citations in your text are
%%% defined by a combination of any bibliography-related LaTeX
%%% packages (such as natbib, harvard, or chicago) and the particular
%%% bibliography style file that you load with the \bibliographystyle
%%% command.  Bibliography-style files end in .bst; you can find them
%%% by searching your file system using whatever tools you have for
%%% doing searches.  (On most modern Unices, ``locate .bst'' will give
%%% you an idea of what's available.)

\bibliographystyle{hmcmath}

%%% The particular bibliography data file or files that you want to
%%% use are specified with the \bibliography file.  Multiple files are
%%% separated by commas.

%%% You might want to use multiple bibliography (or ``bib'') files if
%%% you had a master bib file containing references you use again and
%%% again, and another containing only records for references for a
%%% particular project.

%%% Many people create a single, large bib file that they use for
%%% everything they write.  That approach requires you to \cite every
%%% reference that you want to use in your document -- using
%%% \nocite{*} with a huge bibliography database will give you a large
%%% bibliography containing many references you haven't consulted for
%%% your particular document!

\bibliography{sample}


%%% Glossary or Index.

%%% Having a glossary or index in a statement of work is overkill.
%%% Just define your terms in the text and you'll be fine.
